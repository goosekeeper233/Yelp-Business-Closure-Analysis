## Analysis

The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
- Feature engineering to create relevant features for the model.
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms to predict business closures.
- Evaluation of model performance and interpretation of results.
